## 💫 About Me

I am a Frontend Engineer with 8+ years of experience building scalable, user-focused web applications using React, TypeScript, and modern frontend tooling.

My background includes working on large, real-world systems such as e-commerce platforms, government service delivery portals, data-driven dashboards, and secure identity verification (eKYC) workflows. I specialize in translating complex business requirements into clean, maintainable frontend architectures.

I have experience leading frontend teams, mentoring junior developers, reviewing code, and collaborating closely with backend engineers, designers, and stakeholders in distributed environments. I care deeply about performance, code quality, usability, and long-term maintainability.

Currently, I am focused on strengthening my expertise in React testing, frontend architecture, and design systems while actively exploring frontend and product-focused roles where I can contribute, grow, and continue learning.

### 🔍 Current Focus
- Building production-ready React + TypeScript projects
- Improving frontend testing with Vitest and React Testing Library
- Designing reusable components and scalable UI patterns
- Preparing for frontend roles in US/global teams
